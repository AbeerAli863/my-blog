<h1>How I would Make My First $100 Online If I Had to Start Over Today</h1>

<p>Starting from scratch? No followers. No money. No experience. That’s exactly how most people begin — including me. So if I had to start again today, here’s exactly what I would do to earn my first $100 online… fast.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Pick 1 Skill That’s in Demand</h2>
<p>I would choose something fast to learn and needed everywhere — like content writing, video editing, or Canva designs. These can be learned in 3–7 days of focused effort using YouTube tutorials.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Build a Simple Portfolio</h2>
<p>I would create 2 or 3 example works. For writing: a blog post. For editing: a sample reel. For design: a mock Instagram carousel. Just enough to show I can deliver.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Offer My Services for Free (Just Once)</h2>
<p>I would DM small Instagram pages or post in Facebook groups: “I am offering 1 free design/edit in exchange for a review.” One good testimonial makes everything easier.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Get My First Paid Client</h2>
<p>Once I have proof, I would start charging $10 to $25 per job. I would keep messaging, posting in groups, and using apps like Fiverr, Upwork, and even LinkedIn.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Upsell or Repeat</h2>
<p>One satisfied client usually leads to more work. Or I would repeat the process with a better offer or faster delivery to get more clients.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Hit $100 and Keep Going</h2>
<p>Even with $15 per job, it takes only 7 clients to hit $100. The trick? Stay consistent, keep learning, and focus on service—not selling.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>My Advice to Beginners:</strong> Don’t waste time on “get rich quick” schemes. Focus on value. Help people. And the money will come—faster than you think.</p>
